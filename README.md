# Material-UI Demo

## What is it?

A Set of React Components that Implement Google's Material Design.

##### What is Google's Material Design?

A visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science.


## Why is it useful?

You can easily add elements from Google's Material Design into your application to take the UI up a notch. You can also easily add in modals, side menu, styled buttons, tables, date pickers, sliders, tool bars, progress bars, grid lists, and so much more into your application. 


# Installation: 

In your terminal run the following command to install material-ui.

`npm install material-ui`

Material-UI was designed with the Roboto font in mind. So be sure to include it in your project in your css file if you would like the rest of your fonts to be the same.

App.css: 
```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500');

body {
    font-family: Roboto;
}
```


# Getting started: 

The quickest way to get up and running is by using the MuiThemeProvider to inject the theme into your application. 

In your index.js import MuiThemeProvider and wrap the app component with MuiThemeProvider.

```
import MuiThemeProvider from 'material-ui/styles/MuiThemeProvider';

ReactDOM.render(
    <MuiThemeProvider>
        <App />,
    <MuiThemeProvider>
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Adding a basic button: 

After you set up MuiThemeProvider to use a raised button in material-ui you simply import RaisedButton from material-ui/RaisedButton and then insert the component into your application. Now you have a fully styled raised button. Its that simple.


```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import RaisedButton from 'material-ui/RaisedButton';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div >
        <RaisedButton label="Click Me" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

## Adding a side menu: 

Open up the Menu.js file.

We will need to import Drawer from material-ui/Drawer and List and ListItem from material-ui/List.

For the icon that we click on to open the side menu we will import IconButton from material-ui/IconButton and ActionGrade fromo material-ui/svg-icons/action/grade.

```
import Drawer from 'material-ui/Drawer';
import {List, ListItem} from 'material-ui/List';

import IconButton from 'material-ui/IconButton';
import ActionGrade from 'material-ui/svg-icons/action/grade';
```

Create a property on state called open and have it set to false. 

```
    this.state = {
        open: false
    };
```

We will need to create a handleToggle method to open and close the side menu. This method should change the open property on state to equal true or false depending on whether it is already open or not. When it is open this.state.open should be true and when it is closed this.state.open should be false. 

```
handleToggle = () => {
    this.setState({
        open: !this.state.open
    });
}
```

In your render within the nav element insert the IconButton component with a prop of onClick equal to this.handleToggle. Inside the IconButton add the ActionGradde component. This will give you a star icon that will open our side menu.

```
        <nav>
          <IconButton onClick={this.handleToggle}>
            <ActionGrade />
          </IconButton>
        </nav>
```

In your render under the nav element insert the Drawer component. This should have a prop of docked equal to false. A prop of width equal to 300. A prop of open equal to this.state.open, and a prop of onRequestChange equal to a function that takes open as the parameter and sets state with that.

```
 <Drawer
        docked={false} 
        width={300} 
        open={this.state.open} 
        onRequestChange={(open) => this.setState({open})}>
</Drawer>
```

  - **Docked:** If true, the Drawer will be docked. In this state, the overlay won't show and clicking on a menu item will not close the Drawer.

  - **Width:** 	The width of the Drawer in pixels or percentage in string format ex. 50% to fill half of the window or 100% and so on. Defaults to using the values from theme.

  - **Open:** If true, the Drawer is opened. Providing a value will turn the Drawer into a controlled component.

  - **OnRequestChange:** Callback function fired when the open state of the Drawer is requested to be changed.



Within your Drawer component add the List component with three ListItem components. The first list item should have a prop of primaryText that is equal to 'Home'. The second should have the same prop but equal to 'About' and the third should be equal to 'Store'.

```
<Drawer
        docked={false} 
        width={300} 
        open={this.state.open} 
        onRequestChange={(open) => this.setState({open})}>
        <List>
          <ListItem primaryText="Home" />
          <ListItem primaryText="About" />
          <ListItem primaryText="Store" />
        </List>
      </Drawer>
```

You now have a basic side menu. However lets add a nested menu within your side menu. 

Add another prop to the third ListItem called nestedItems that is equal to an object with an array. The first item in the array is a ListItem component with a primaryText prop equal to 'Tops'. 

The second item in the array is a ListItem component with a primaryText prop equal to 'Bottoms'. 

The first item in the array is a ListItem component with a primaryText prop equal to 'Accessories'. 

```
      <Drawer
        docked={false} 
        width={300} 
        open={this.state.open} 
        onRequestChange={(open) => this.setState({open})}>
        <List>
          <ListItem primaryText="Home" />
          <ListItem primaryText="About" />
          <ListItem
            primaryText="Store"
            nestedItems={[
              <ListItem
                primaryText="Tops"
              />,
              <ListItem
                primaryText="Bottoms"
              />,
              <ListItem
                primaryText="Accessories"
              />,
            ]}
          />
        </List>
      </Drawer>
  ```
   
   - **PrimaryText:** This is the block element that contains the primary text. If a string is passed in, a div tag will be rendered.

   - **NestedItems:** An array of ListItems to nest underneath the current ListItem.



  You now have a nested menu within your side menu. If we want add a nested menu within the nested menu we would add the nestedItems prop to our 'Accessories' ListItem that is equal to an object with an array and it would have three ListItem components. The first would have a primaryText equal to 'Hats'. The second will be equal to 'Jewelry' and the third 'Scarves'.

  ```
        <Drawer
        docked={false} 
        width={300} 
        open={this.state.open} 
        onRequestChange={(open) => this.setState({open})}>
        <List>
          <ListItem primaryText="Home" />
          <ListItem primaryText="About" />
          <ListItem
            primaryText="Store"
            nestedItems={[
              <ListItem
                primaryText="Tops"
              />,
              <ListItem
                primaryText="Bottoms"
              />,
              <ListItem
                primaryText="Accessories"
                nestedItems={[
                  <ListItem primaryText="Hats" />,
                  <ListItem primaryText="Jewelry" />,
                  <ListItem kprimaryText="Scarves" />,
                ]}
              />,
            ]}
          />
        </List>
      </Drawer>
```


You should now have a working dialog Menu component that you can import and inject into your app.js

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Menu from './components/Menu';
import DialogBox from './components/DialogBox';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div >
        <Menu/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

If you want to change the background of the side menu you can add the containerStyle prop and set that equal to an object with backgroundColor as the property and whatever color you'd like as the value.

```
  containerStyle={{backgroundColor: 'gray'}}
```

## Adding a dialog modal:

Open up the DialogBox.js file. 

We will need to import Dialog from material-ui/Dialog, FlatButton from material-ui/FlatButton, RaisedButton and material-ui/RaisedButton.

```
import Dialog from 'material-ui/Dialog';
import FlatButton from 'material-ui/FlatButton';
import RaisedButton from 'material-ui/RaisedButton';
```

Create a property on state called open and set it to false. 
```
    state = {
      open: false,
    };
```

Now we need to create a method that will open the modal and a method to close the modal. 

```
      handleOpen = () => {
        this.setState({
          open: true
        });
      };
    
      handleClose = () => {
        this.setState({
          open: false
        });
      };
```

In your return create a raised button with a label of delete that on click will fire the handleOpen method. 

```
        return (
          <div>
            <RaisedButton label="Delete" onClick={this.handleOpen} />
          </div>
        );
```

Below your return create a dialog component with title equal to 'Are you sure you want to delete this?', modal equal to false, open equal to this.state.open, and onRequestClose equal to this.handle close.  

Add actions equal to actions and in the next step we will create the actions. 

```
        return (
          <div>
            <RaisedButton label="Delete" onClick={this.handleOpen} />
            <Dialog
              title="Are you sure you want to delete this?"
              actions={actions}
              modal={false}
              open={this.state.open}
              onRequestClose={this.handleClose}
            >             
            </Dialog>
          </div>
        );
```

  - **Title:** The title to display on the Dialog. Could be number, string, element or an array containing these types.

  - **Actions:** 	Action buttons to display below the Dialog content (children). This property accepts either a React element, or an array of React elements.

  - **Modal:** Force the user to use one of the actions in the Dialog. Clicking outside the Dialog will not trigger the onRequestClose.

  - **Open:** If true, the Drawer is opened. Providing a value will turn the Drawer into a controlled component.

  - **OnRequestClose:** Fired when the Dialog is requested to be closed by a click outside the Dialog or on the buttons.



Above your return in your render, add an array called actions that has two items. The they are both flat buttons with primary equal to true and onClick equal to this.handleClose. The first should have a lable of 'Cancel' and the second should have a label of 'Delete and a keyboardFocused set to true. 

```
        const actions = [
          <FlatButton
            label="Cancel"
            primary={true}
            onClick={this.handleClose}
          />,
          <FlatButton
            label="Delete"
            primary={true}
            keyboardFocused={true}
            onClick={this.handleClose}
          />,
        ];

```

  - **Label:** Label for the button.

  - **Primary:** 	If true, colors button according to primaryTextColor from the Theme.

  - **KeyboardFocused:** Force the user to use one of the actions in the Dialog. Clicking outside the Dialog will not trigger the onRequestClose.


You should now have a working dialog modal component that you can import and inject into your app.js in between an section element.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import DialogBox from './components/DialogBox';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div >
        <Menu/>
        <section>
         <DialogBox/>
        </section>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
